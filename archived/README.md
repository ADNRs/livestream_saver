# Archived scripts.

These obsolete scripts may still be useful as long as they work.

This was originally a [gist](https://gist.github.com/glubsy/6e9b3061e074f528ea7153647f9fe615), forked from this [script by @cheadrian](https://gist.github.com/cheadrian/b661fb68a6a87ea64069e641cef68c3e). That script is still made available for manual download as `manual_download.py`.

## manual_download.py

While it should work fine, it is very basic and not very convenient to use.
For this you have to be logged into Youtube, grab the links from your web browser's developer tools, and manually replace the `vid_link` and `sound_link` variables every time.
After the script has downloaded all the segments, use `pre_merge.py`.

## pre_merge.py

This script simply renames the downloaded segments to be compatible this other [merge script](https://github.com/mrwnwttk/youtube_stream_capture/blob/main/merge.py) which can properly merge the segments together (thanks to ffmpeg).
It creates symbolic links to the files located in `stream_capture_IDHASH/aud` and `stream_capture_IDHASH/vid` into one directory called `segments_IDHASH`.
You can remove that directory after the final video file has been generated by that other merge script mentioned above.

## Example:

1. Open the Youtube live stream in your browser
2. Get the video and audio links from the developer tools (CTRL+I)
3. Copy them in `vid_link=` and `audio_link=` variables
4. ```$> python manual_download.py```
5. Once chunks have been downloaded in `stream_capture_IDHASH`, call
```$> python pre_merge.py```
6. Call [youtube_stream_capture/merge.py](https://github.com/mrwnwttk/youtube_stream_capture/blob/main/merge.py) like this ```$> merge.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDHASH```
7. If everything worked, you have the final video file generated. You can remove the `segments_IDHASH` directory containing the symbolic links, as well as the source chunks


## join_segments.sh

This script is currently obsolete, but could be fixed by calling ffmpeg the same way as the above decent script. I can't be bothered to rewrite this for now.
